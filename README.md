# MuseDrops
A project where people post their "Muses" and they are displayed a customizable raindrops in a feed.

The project uses React, and Express/Node. Planning to impliment mongoDB for it's database for the time that the project is alive. Afterward I will likely host the project on github with the data from the DB stored in JSON files statically, and remove the ability to post new "Droplets"
